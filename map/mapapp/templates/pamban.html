        <h4>The Pamban Bridge, located in Tamil Nadu, India, is a historic railway bridge that connects the town of Mandapam on the mainland with Rameswaram Island. Opened in 1914, it was Indiaâ€™s first sea bridge and remained the longest until the Bandra-Worli Sea Link was completed in 2010. Stretching about 2.3 kilometers over the Palk Strait, the bridge is an engineering marvel, especially known for its double-leaf bascule section that can be raised to allow ships to pass through. Its strategic location and unique design make it both a lifeline for transport and a tourist attraction, offering breathtaking views of the sea. Today, alongside the old railway bridge, a new road bridge also facilitates easier connectivity, but the century-old Pamban Bridge continues to stand as a symbol of resilience and innovation.</h4>
