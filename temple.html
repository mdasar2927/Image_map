        <h4>Ramar Padam Temple, also called Ramar Patham, is located on Gandhamadhana Parvatham, about 3 km from the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram district. It is the highest point on the island and is famous for the footprint of Lord Rama carved on a stone chakra in the sanctum. According to legend, Lord Rama stood here while searching for Lanka after Sita was taken away by Ravana. The temple is a two-storeyed mandapam and offers a panoramic view of the sea and the island. This sacred site is an important stop for pilgrims visiting Rameswaram.</h4>
